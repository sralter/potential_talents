    "In an effort to explore other ranking algorithms, we will now turn to LambdaRank. It is an evolution of the RankNet algorithm that we worked on above. While RankNet looks to optimize pairwise accuracy, LambdaRank optimizes for ranking metrics like NDCG, or Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain. This checks not only if the first item should be ranked higher than the second, but also how much swapping their order would improve the final ranking. The gain can be thought of this way: if a relevant item is placed close to the top, it will have a greater gain than if a relevant item was placed towards the bottom. RankNet also takes advantage of a loss function and cares about individual rankings, while LambdaRank uses **lambdas** that help adjust the model's focus to help improve the overall ranking quality.\n",

    "You can read more about LambdaRank [here](https://tamaracucumides.medium.com/learning-to-rank-with-lightgbm-code-example-in-python-843bd7b44574). There's a short snippet of information about LambdaRank [from Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/from-ranknet-to-lambdarank-to-lambdamart-an-overview/). Researchers there designed the algorithm.\n",
