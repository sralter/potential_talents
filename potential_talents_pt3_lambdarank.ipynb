    "In an effort to explore other ranking algorithms, we will now turn to LambdaRank. It is an evolution of the RankNet algorithm that we worked on above. While RankNet looks to optimize pairwise accuracy, LambdaRank optimizes for ranking metrics like NDCG, or Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain. It does not require pairwise comparisons as input. \n",

The gain can be thought of this way: if a relevant item is placed close to the top, it will have a greater gain than if a relevant item was placed towards the bottom. \n",
